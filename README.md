# Voting System

We have created a Voting-System Web Application, using MVC, that allows a user to vote one of the existent candidates.

We will save and process the following user data:
 - Username (how a user wants to be named in our application, the Username should be Unique)
 - First Name
 - Last Name
 - Date of Birth
 - CNP

DEV Options:
 - ID (an auto-incrementing component that assures data uniqueness)
 - HasVoted (a boolean variable that is true if the user has voted, false otherwise)
 - CandidateID (if the user has voted, we will save the candidate ID)



We will save and process the following data about the candidates:
 - First Name
 - Last Name
 - Description

DEV Options:
 - ID (an auto-incrementing component that assures data uniqueness)
 - NumberOfVotes (a number that represents the number of users that voted this candidate)



# ADMIN

The admin can add new candidates, and view the number of votes for each candidate.
